I am the University of Rochester's [BioRender](https://biorender.com/) Campus Ambassador. BioRender is a platform for researchers to easily create professional scientific figures.
As a Campus Ambassador, I introduce and promote BioRender to my fellow trainees and faculty at the University of Rochester. 
I work with the BioRender team to host events at my university.
Trainees and faculty can bring questions or suggestions about BioRender to me that I can pass along to improve the BioRender experience.
