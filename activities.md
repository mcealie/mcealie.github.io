## Graduate Community Assistant for [Graduate and Family Housing](https://www.rochester.edu/reslife/graduate/index.html)

Graduate Community Assistants (GCAs) work for University of Rochester [Graduate and Family Housing](https://www.rochester.edu/reslife/graduate/index.html) to support 
residents and build community. As a GCA, I welcome new residents, plan monthly programming, and disseminate university policy. I manage a budget of $400 per semester 
and report to the Assistant Director of Graduate, Family & Off-Campus Housing. I attend various staff trainings and meetings throughout the school year with my fellow 
GCAs.
