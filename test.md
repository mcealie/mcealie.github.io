## Chief Financial Officer of the [Graduate Student Society](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/education/graduate/current-students/graduate-student-society.aspx)

The Graduate Student Society [(GSS)](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/education/graduate/current-students/graduate-student-society.aspx) is a graduate student-run organization 
that represents graduate students at the School of Medicine and Dentistry at the University of Rochester. We advocate for graduate students and plan social and academic events.
As the CFO, I manage a yearly budget of $6,000. I also attend monthly leadership meetings with the Dean of Graduate Affairs to discuss issues related to graduate student life.
I have also served on the Graduate Student Appreciation Week Committee with trainees and leaders across the University of Rochester campus.
