## About Me

I am a 4th year Neuroscience PhD Candidate at the University of Rochester. I received my MS in Neuroscience when I successfully passed my PhD Qualifying Exam. This [work](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/news/publications/neuroscience/student-spotlight-makenna-cealie) was later funded by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) as an F31 titled “Effects of Developmental Ethanol Exposure on Cerebellar Microglia and Purkinje Cells.” 

I study the effects of developmental ethanol exposure on cerebellar microglia dynamics and their interactions with Purkinje cells using two-photon, in vivo imaging in [Dr. Ania Majewska's laboratory](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/labs/majewska.aspx)  

I am a Graduate Community Assistant for University of Rochester [Graduate and Family Housing](https://www.rochester.edu/reslife/graduate/index.html)

I am the Chief Financial Officer of the [Graduate Student Society.](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/education/graduate/current-students/graduate-student-society.aspx)

I am the University of Rochester's [BioRender](https://biorender.com/) Campus Ambassador.
